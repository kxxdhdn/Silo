#+TITLE: astylo IDL library
#+AUTHOR: D. HU

* About Me
This lib consists of IDL routines used by astylo (in this case, functions in astylo serve as the interface), including the resolution convolution ([[https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~ganiano/Kernels.html][Aniano]], a Python core version is under development), MIR spectral fitting, /etc./
* User Guide
** In order to use ~ipro.iconvolve~, you need to download idlib and put it in proper place. 
~convolve_image.pro~ - core program ([[https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~ganiano/Kernels/convolve_image.pro][source]])
~conv_prog.pro~ - configuration file. 
~conv.pro~ - executable file.
1. Download convolution kernels from [[https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~ganiano/Kernels/][Index of =/~ganiano/Kernels=]] (=Ker_2012= / =Kernels_fits_Files= / =Hi_Resolution=)
2. Open ~convolve_image.pro~, search and modify: 
   - *~images_path~* (corresponding to ~convdir~ or the path of ~filIN~ if ~convdir=None~, images to convolve)
   - *~kernels_path~* (corresponding to the path of ~kfile~, convolution kernels)
   - *~convolutions_path~* (should be the same as *~images_path~*, convolved images)
   (These paths are stored in the csv file (kernelist.csv) generated by ~iconvolve.choker~)
3. Open ~conv_prog.pro~, modify *klist* to fit ~klist~ in ~iconvolve~
4. ~idldir~ of ~iconvolve.do_conv~ should fit the path of idlib
5. Examples see tests/ ~test_ipro~ "TEST iconvolve"
