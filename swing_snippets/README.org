For synthetic photometry

* Installation Guide
1. Open ~utilities.f90~, search **/path/of/this/file** and modify *LibF* with the location of this file in your machine.
2. Launch a terminal window and change directories to the same directory.
3. Execute the installation program by entering the following command. 
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make
   #+END_SRC
4. Add this directory to your environment variable ~$PATH~ (e.g. in ~.bashrc~)
5. [Optional] Run the test. (sss: Swing Snippets for Synthetic photometry)
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cd Tests
   python test_sss.py
   #+END_SRC
6. [Optional] To uninstall, just run 
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make mrproper
   #+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting
- ~swing_snippets~ is extracted from F. Galliano's library ~SwING~ which is not yet published. To compile it, you need h5fc library which can be obtained by installing [[https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/][hdf5]]. Note that if you have other hdf5 installed for example by anaconda, there might be conflicts when calling h5fc. Make sure the correct ~/hdf5/bin~ is on the top of environment variable ~$PATH~.
