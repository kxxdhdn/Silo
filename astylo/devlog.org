- Note taken on [2020-04-17 Fri 18:35] \\
  For extrapolation off (extrapoff) option, we can simply set zeros for the uncovered beginning of the spectrum, and this step can avoid important bias given by the extrapolation. While for the end of spectrum, it is not right to set zeros considering the non-negligible continuum, etc. although the total flux can be less. (Spectra in the context of mid-IR range.)
